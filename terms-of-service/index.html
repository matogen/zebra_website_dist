      <div>
        <p><strong>1. Indemnity</strong></p>
        <p>The Client hereby indemnifies and holds Matogen Global Holdings (Pty) Ltd, recursively including all of its
          subsidiary companies, its officials, its business associations and its business partners of whatsoever nature,
          hereinafter collectively called Matogen harmless from any loss, liability or expense the Client may incur or
          suffer, of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising, pursuant to the introductory and/or negotiation and/or
          facilitation services Matogen may provide to the Client in the Client’s desire to procure certain, or
          alternatively, specific corporate resources from sources known or associated to Matogen.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Termination</strong></p>
        <p> The Client hereby acknowledges and agrees that Matogen may terminate its services or involvement with the
          Client, at any stage or at any time during the introductory and/or negotiation and/or facilitation process, by
          giving the Client written notice thereof, without Matogen having to provide the Client with any specific
          explanation or reason, or without Matogen having any legal or financial obligation or liability towards the
          Client of whatsoever nature, under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any breach of this contract.</li>
          <li>Outstanding payments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3. Software Development Requests and Quotations</strong></p>
        <p> The Client warrants and agrees that Matogen has made the Client aware and that the Client has been informed
          of the following fundamental facts and conditions, which the Client fully understands:</p>
        <p><strong>3.1 Quotations</strong></p>
        <p> The Client may at any time request work to be done by Matogen, on which Matogen will provide the Client with
          a quotation for the costs involved. This quotation will have to be approved by the Client before Matogen can
          start on the work. Matogen will not bill the Client for any work that was not explicitly agreed upon by the
          Client to be paid for by the Client.</p>
        <p>Kindly also take note that quotations normally require a deposit to be made by the Client in order to commit
          to the project. All quotations will contain payment conditions that have to be honoured upon acceptance of
          quotation. If payment conditions are not acceptable to the Client, the Client must inform Matogen of this
          before accepting the quotation, because accepting a quotation irrevocably implies that the Client fully agrees
          with all the terms presented with it.</p>
        <p>Some items in a quotation document may be dependent on others. Therefore if the Client decides to exclude
          some items, Matogen reserves the right to update the cost of other items, provided Matogen has notified the
          Client before the quoted development commences.</p>
        <p>In practice, most quotations refer to deliverables without specifying any detail about the quality that is
          expected with the service. In general, these quotations are based on acceptable professional standards. If the
          Client feels that the quality delivered is not acceptable after it was delivered, and the quality of the
          deliverable in question was not specified with measurable quantities (for example via benchmarks or ratings)
          in the agreed quotation, Matogen reserves the right to charge extra for any quality improvements.</p>
        <p>In general, unless explicitly specified, work cannot be assumed to be included in any quotation. The
          following are typical examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Client is expected to supply all content (text information) for its software or website. Unless
            specified, copywriting or any professional text editing is not included in any quotations.</li>
          <li>Taking photos or finding photos on the internet is not included in quotations unless specified.</li>
          <li>Training is not included by default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Matogen may suggest the best and most efficient process to follow with a project. Although the Client may
          choose to do it on the Client’s own terms, Matogen reserves the right to charge extra for such procedure.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2 Pay-per-hour (Time and material billing)</strong></p>
        <p> In the absence of any formal agreement, all work requested by the Client will be subject to be billed on an
          hourly basis calculated at the standard tariffs of the time (which may differ based on the experience and
          availability of the resources being utilized).</p>
        <p>The Client expressly agrees to only request work from Matogen if the Client is willing to pay for it;
          including making payment in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>The Client expressly confirms that the Client was made aware of and understands that the Client is ultimately
          solely responsible for all risks regarding pay-per-hour work, such as, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The work takes longer than anticipated.</li>
          <li>The tasks are more difficult than anticipated.</li>
          <li>The work contains flaws (especially in deadline-driven scenarios that apply stress to resources).</li>
          <li>Miscommunication is causing wrong work to be carried out.</li>
          <li>The work requested does not ultimately solve the business requirement.</li>
          <li>The Client does not need the work already carried out any more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4. Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights</strong></p>
        <p> As used herein, “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all technical or business information,
          including third-party information, furnished in connection with this Agreement, in whatever tangible form or
          medium, or disclosed by Client to Matogen (including, but not limited to, product/service specifications,
          prototypes, computer files and programs, models, drawings, marketing plans, financial data and personnel
          statistics).</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the termination, expiration or cancellation of this Agreement, Matogen agrees to treat such
          Confidential Information as confidential for a period of three years from the date of receipt of same unless
          otherwise agreed to in writing by Client, and that during such period Matogen shall use same solely for the
          purposes of this Agreement unless otherwise allowed herein or by written permission of Client. In handling the
          Confidential Information, Matogen agrees:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>not to copy such Confidential Information unless specifically authorized;</li>
          <li>not to make disclosure of any such Confidential Information to anyone except employees and independent
            contractors and subcontractors to whom disclosure is necessary for the purposes set forth above; and</li>
          <li>to appropriately notify such employees and independent contractors and subcontractors that the disclosure
            is made in confidence and shall be kept in confidence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The obligations set forth herein shall be satisfied by Matogen through the exercise of at least the same
          degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of its own information of like importance but not less than
          a reasonable degree of care. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, Confidential Information
          may be disclosed as may be required by law, regulation or court or agency order or demand, after prompt prior
          notification to the Client of such required disclosure.</p>
        <p>Matogen agrees that in the event permission is granted by Client to copy Confidential Information, or that
          copying is otherwise permitted hereunder, each such copy shall contain and state the same confidential or
          proprietary notices or legends, if any, which appear on the original. Nothing herein shall be construed as
          granting to either party any right or license under any copyrights, inventions, or patents now or hereafter
          owned or controlled by the other party. Upon termination, cancellation or expiration of this Agreement for any
          reason or upon request of the disclosing party, all Confidential Information, together with any copies of same
          as may be authorized herein, shall be returned to the Client.</p>
        <p>The obligations imposed in this document shall not apply to any information that: (1) is already in
          possession of or is independently developed by the receiving party; or (2) is or becomes publicly available
          through no fault of the receiving party; or (3) is obtained by the receiving party from a third person without
          breach by such third person of an obligation of confidence with respect to the Confidential Information
          disclosed; or (4) is required to be disclosed pursuant to the lawful order of a government agency or
          disclosure is required by operation of the law.</p>
        <p>The requirements of use and confidentiality set forth herein shall survive the expiration, termination or
          cancellation of this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Warranty</strong></p>
        <p>Disclaimers: Client represents and warrants to Matogen that Client has the power and authority to enter into
          and perform its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
        <p>Matogen shall perform all Services in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry standards.
          Matogen hereby warrants that the provision of the Services shall meet the requirements and perform the
          operations and functions in accordance with and as set forth in the relevant Task Order or Change Order.</p>
        <p>Matogen makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, concerning any product described herein,
          including without limitation, any representations or warranties concerning the design, use or performance of
          any such Product or any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
        <p>Products are sold “as is”, and the Client assumes the entire risk as to their quality, performance or
          suitability. In no event will Matogen be liable to Client under any Order for direct, indirect, special,
          incidental or consequential damages (such as loss of profits) resulting from any defect in the Services or the
          Products, their documentation or their installation, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. In
          particular, Matogen does not warrant that the operation or use of the Product will be error-free and
          uninterrupted.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Limitation of Liability and Disclaimers</strong></p>
        <p>Security: Client is solely responsible for the security, confidentiality and integrity of all messages and
          the content received, transmitted through or stored on any email/web hosting or server hosting service (the
          “Hosting Service”). Client is solely responsible for any authorized or unauthorized access to Client’s
          accounts by any person. Client agrees to bear all responsibility for the confidentiality of any passwords and
          all use or charges incurred from use of the Hosting Service with Client’s password.</p>
        <p>Privacy: It is the policy of Matogen to respect Client’s privacy. Matogen will not monitor, edit, or disclose
          any personal information about Client’s accounts, including hosted content, without Client’s prior consent,
          unless Matogen has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with legal process or
          other legal requirements of any relevant authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Matogen;
          (iii) enforce the terms of a Task Order, this Agreement or these Terms and Conditions; or (iv) protect the
          interests of users of Matogen Hosting Services other than Client or any other person. Client acknowledges and
          agrees that Client’s IP address is transmitted and recorded with each message sent from the Hosting Service.
        </p>
        <p><strong>7. Invoicing and Payment</strong></p>
        <p>Matogen shall invoice the Client on the basis set forth in the relevant legal agreement, task order, change
          order or else on a time & material basis. Unless otherwise indicated on the invoice or in the legal agreement,
          invoices shall be payable upon receipt.</p>
        <p>In the event of a default with respect to the payment of an invoice or any part thereof, Client shall be
          liable for all of Matogen’s reasonable costs, disbursements and fees, including but not limited to attorneys’
          fees, incurred in the collection of any amounts due.</p>
        <p><strong>8. Refund policy</strong></p>
        <p>At Matogen we are committed to providing a service of exceptional quality and reliability. In the event you
          are not satisfied with your order, this section explains our refund policy. Prior to ordering, to help ensure
          that our service meets your requirements, please refer to our service details for comprehensive information on
          all features offered under each plan. To help you make the right decision, you can also contact a customer
          service representative to discuss your online needs.</p>
        <p>All services are done in good faith. We generally take upfront and subsequent payments. If at any time in the
          service rendering process, you are not satisfied with the quality of work, you may request not to pay any
          further payments unless the services are rendered. By paying, you are indicating that you have
          inspected/tested the product or service and accept it “In Good Order”. Please validate the work with each
          order to ensure that the services meet your expectations, as payment is considered an implicit acceptance of
          services rendered.</p>
        <p>In general, we will not refund payments on services rendered and subsequently accepted by you. No refund is
          made, if you have accepted any work performed to date. Your payment of billable services indicates your
          acceptance of quality and functionality.</p>
        <p>Refunds are only possible if we are unable to render the services to you and this will be determined by our
          sole discretion.</p>
        <p>You are not entitled to a refund of any of our services if you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simply change your mind or no longer want the services;</li>
          <li>Realise you can’t afford the services; Found the same services at a cheaper price elsewhere;</li>
          <li>Choose the wrong specifications for the service;</li>
          <li>Knew about the particular fault prior to purchase;</li>
          <li>and/or Were responsible for causing the fault.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are entitled to a refund, you can choose between a refund, exchange or we may attempt to correct the
          problem for you. All refunds must be paid directly into a bank account (no cash or cheque payouts will be
          done).</p>
        <p><strong>9. Copyright</strong></p>
        <p>Unless specified, the Client will retain the full sole ownership of all software code and media (for example
          graphics, animations and video) developed by Matogen which was paid for in full. Unpaid work will remain the
          property of Matogen.</p>
        <p>Any data supplied by the Client will remain the sole property of the Client.</p>
        <p>Any database on Client’s website will remain the sole property of Client, and Matogen shall not have any
          rights to use this for any purposes.</p>
        <p>For software systems to be developed by Matogen that Client plans to resell, Client must notify Matogen of
          intent before start of contract, because many software libraries available might have licencing limitations on
          the Client’s sole right and this need to be taken into account before formal agreement is concluded.</p>
        <p><strong>10. Email communication</strong></p>

            href="https://matogen.com/email-disclaimers">email disclaimer</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>11. Governing Law</strong></p>
        <p>The validity, interpretation and performance of the rights and obligations of the Client and Matogen are
          governed by the laws of South Africa without regard to its rules concerning conflicts of law. The parties
          hereto irrevocably consent to suit and submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the Republic of
          South Africa.</p>
        <p>South African legislation requires companies to publish their policies and procedures with requests to access
          information by 3rd parties. In adherence to this law, Matogen’s Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA)
